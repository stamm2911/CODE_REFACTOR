# <Code-refactor>
## Description
This repo contains a Code Refactoring Excercise. In its first version, the HTML & CSS files are a mock up of a marketing agency webpage.

The motivation behind this project, is to improve writting clean & elegant code.

The opportunity areas of the mock up code were, semantic structure for the HTML file, and code redundancy and no logical order for the CSS file.

The take aways of this project are:
- Always use the best Semantic HTML tags available to describe the code of a section
- Always use the proper identation
- Always use accessible attributes to follow Accessibility Standars
- Always make sure the headings fall in sequential order
- Always make sure the page Title is a concise and descriptive title
- Always make sure your CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized following semantic structure
- Always make sure CSS files are propertly commented
